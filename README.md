# Haskell Heaven

Welcome to a sweeping survey of Haskell Heaven ! :)

Here I am, trying to document my journey to this hallowed land, via my personal "snaps" of beautiful places in the vast landscape of Functional Heaven that is Haskell! 

Like any _travelogue_, my wish/hope is that this rambling set of essays stokes an interest in fellow wanderers, to get a first-hand glimpse of Haskell Heaven that I so excitedly portray! 

## Salient features

There are many aspects of Haskell that stand out as beautiful peaks of research and evolution in the confluence of Mathematics (Lambda Calculus, Category Theory, etc.) & Computer Science. Some of them are as below:

+ _Functions_ that mirror their mathematical counterparts, with the default of no side-effects
+ Inspiration from Category Theory, which aims to subsume all of Set Theory, with a programming language--no mean feat indeed! Haskell thus has many concepts from _Category Theory_ like _Functors, Monads, Monoids, Arrows_, etc. Most of Haskell's staple of concepts have a sound mathematical foundation, unlike other programming languages which compromised rigor for various reasons.
+ _Lazy evaluation_. This allows working with infinite data structures and provides great support for _modularity_.
+ _Purity_. Side-effects in Functions are explicitly modeled, allowing separation of pure & impure code, thus helping reason about program correctness.
+ A very expressive type system with powerful type inference built in.
+ _'Beautiful Concurrency'_, to borrow a phrase from one of the designers of Haskell, Simon Peyton Jones.
+ Many more features which will be explored here...

Functional Programming is gaining a lot of traction in the industry too, from its initial origins in academic research, to real-world applications.

Sample this for a Hello-World pogram:

``` python
print("Hello World!")
```
