# Haskell Heaven

Welcome to a sweeping survey of Haskell Heaven !!! &lt;3 :)

Here I am, trying to document my journey to this hallowed land, via my personal "snaps" of beautiful places in the vast landscape of Functional Heaven that is Haskell! 

Like any travelogue, my wish/hope is that this rambling set of essays stokes an interest in fellow wanderers, to get a first-hand glimpse of Haskell Heaven that I so excitedly portray! 

## Salient features

There are many aspects of Haskell that stand out as beautiful peaks of research and evolution in the confluence of Mathematics (Lambda Calculus, Category Theory, etc.) & Computer Science. Some of them are as below:

+ Functions that mirror their mathematical counterparts, with the default of no side-effects
+ Inspiration from Category Theory, which aims to subsume all of Set Theory, with a programming language--no mean feat indeed! Haskell thus has many concepts from Category Theory like _Functors, Monads, Monoids, Arrows_, etc. Most of Haskell's staple of concepts have a sound mathematical foundation, unlike other programming languages which compromised rigor for various reasons.
+ Lazy evaluation, which allows working with infinite data structures and provides great support for _modularity_.
+ Purity! Side-effects in Functions are explicitly modeled, allowing separation of pure & impure code, thus helping reason about program correctness.
+ Strong expressive Type system with Type Inference
+ `Beautiful Concurrency' to borrow a phrase form Simon Peyton Jones
+ Many more features which will be explained here...

Functional Programming is gaining such traction in the industry too, from its initial origins in academic research, to real-world applications involving the solution of long-standing challenges in Computer Science.
