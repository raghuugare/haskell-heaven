      <h2>Types</h2>

      <p>
	      Types are Haskell's best approximations of the mathematical notion of Sets. In fact, Haskell takes the notion of types to a deeper level, associating even functions with their own 'types', we shall see soon now. 
      </p>

      <h3>What is a type?</h3>

      <blockquote>At its simplest, a <strong>type</strong> can be thought of as a <strong>set</strong> of related <em>values</em> sharing some common traits.</blockquote>

      <p>
	      Some simple examples of types are <code>Bool</code> which is a set of only 2 values <em>viz.</em>, \(\{True, False\} \). Other common types are <code>Int</code> &amp; <code>Integer</code> which represent the set of all <em>integers</em> which is shown in math by the symbol \(\mathbb{Z}\).
      </p>

      <p>
	      In Haskell, a function \(f\) that maps an argument of type Int to a return value of type Int is depicted as below:<br>
      </p>
      
      <p class="math">\(f :: Int \rightarrow Int\)</p>

			<p>
				In reality, however, we do have some issues. Although the set of integers is essentially <em>infinite</em>, the set of integers we have on computers is actually <em>finite</em>. You can think of this in terms of a concept in mathematics you might have come across in Calculus, particularly while dealing with the infinite set of the so called <strong>Real Numbers</strong> denoted by \( \mathbb{R} \) &ndash; called <strong>the interval</strong> of a <strong>set</strong>.
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				An <strong>interval</strong> of a <strong>set</strong> is a <strong>subset</strong> of the set such that it contains atleast 2 members and contains all members of the set between any 2 elements belonging to the interval (<em>i.e.</em>, no member of the set is left out in the interval).
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				<em>E.g.</em>, the set of all integers such that \( x > 8 \) is an interval. But the set of all non-zero integers is <strong>not</strong> an interval since it leaves out the element zero (\(0\)). Clearly an interval could be <strong>finite</strong> or <strong>infinite</strong>. Also, if the end-points of the interval belong to it, the interval is said to be <strong>closed</strong>; else it is called an <strong>open</strong> interval. Of course, as you must have guessed, an interval can be closed or opern at either end-points. Below are some examples in set notation.

        In general, when we see something of the form \(v :: T\), it means a value \(v\) ``has type'' \(T\).
