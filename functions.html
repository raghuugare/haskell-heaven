			<h2>Functions</h2>

			<p>
				Functions are the <em>raison d'être</em><sup><a href="#fn_01" id="ref_01">1</a></sup> of Functional Programming (Duh!). But it is very surprising to see that many people have some subtle mis-conceptions about the idea of a function, and this leads to difficulties later on while reasoning about functional programming ideas. It is therefore wise to spend some time &amp; effort towards getting a clear picture of functions.
			</p>

			<p>
			Let us consider some familiar and not-so-familiar examples involving functions from various subjects.
			</p>
			
			<h3> Mathematics? Solve for \(x\) when \(ax^{2}+ bx + \ldots \) ??</h3>
			
			<p>
				Consider the famous Quadratic <em>equation</em> :
			</p>

			<p class="math">
				\( a x^{2} + b x + c = 0 \)
			</p>

			<p>
				The above equation states that some function of the <strong>independent variable</strong> \(x\) is equal to the <strong>expression</strong> \( {\mbox ax^{2} + bx + c }\) and that it evaluates to <em>zero</em> for <em>some</em> (input) values of \(x\) which are called the <strong>roots</strong> of the <em>equation</em>.<br>
				Symbolically, we can write this as follows:
			</p>

			<p class="math">
				\(f(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c = 0 \)
			</p>

			<p>
				Given the constants \(a\), \(b\), &amp; \(c\), we say that the above expression is a <em>function of</em> (=<em>dependent upon</em>) the (<em>independent</em>) variable "x". The <em>equation</em> simply gave us a <em>constraint</em> under which we would proceed to derive expressions for the <em>roots</em> for the given constants. In other words, the we wanted to know for what values of \(x\) does the function \(f(x)\) produce the value of zero (\(0\))?
			</p>

			<h3>Ok, how about Physics ?</h3>
			
			<p> Or...do you remember the <em>equation</em> from the Physics of Motion describing the <strong>final velocity</strong> \(v\) of an object with an <strong>initial velocity</strong> of \(u\) units, moving under a <em>constant</em> <strong>acceleration</strong> of \( a \) units after a <strong>time</strong> \( t \) ??</p>

			<p class="math">
				\( v = u + at \)
			</p>

			<p><strong>Yes!</strong><br><br>
				There <em>is</em> a function hidden here too. <br>
				Given all things, the final velocity \( v \) is a function of time, and can be written as:
			</p>

			<p class="math">
				\(v(t) = u + at\)
			</p>

			<h3>What <em>is</em> a function then?</h3>

			<blockquote>A function \(f\) is simply a <strong>mapping</strong> from a set (called the <strong>domain</strong>) <em>to</em> another set, which is usually called the function's <strong>range</strong>.</blockquote>

			<p>For example, the function represented by the mathematical expression \(x^{2}\) could be a mapping from the set of both positive & negative integers like \(\{\ldots,-3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, \ldots\}\) to the set of positive integers that are perfect squares, such as \(\{0, +1, +4, +9, +16, \ldots\}\)</p>

			<h3>So are functions exclusively for mathematical stuff ?? </h3>

			<p>
				<strong>No!</strong><br><br>
				This is a major <em>myth</em> about functions among people trying to <em>grok</em> them.<br><br>
				Consider the function that maps the name of a country to its capital city.
				Such a function does not involve any math expressions.
				But still, it is a perfectly valid example of what mathematicians would call a function.
				Remember the <em>mapping</em> part of the definition above to remind you of what constitutes a function!	
			</p>

			<h3>Mathematical notation for a function</h3>

			<p>
				In mathematics, a function is denoted as a <em>mapping</em> in symbolic form as below:<br><br>

				<span class="math">\(f: D \rightarrow R\)</span><br> where \(D\) is the <strong>Domain</strong> and \(R\) is the <strong>Range</strong> of the function \(f\).
			</p>

			<p>
				In words, we could read this as, <blockquote>For every member of the set \(D\) given as the input, the function \(f\) provides a <strong>unique</strong> value that is a member of the set \(R\).</blockquote> That is, given the same input, we ought to get the same output from the mapping for it to qualify as a proper function.</quote>
			</p>

			<h3>Functions in Haskell</h3>

			<p>Let us now see how Haskell brings the beauty of functions preserving the purity & the rigor of the concept.</p>

			<p>Consider a function defined over the domain of integers which maps its inputs to their corresponding squares.</p>

			<p>Suppose we call this function \(square\) . We can obtain this "mapping" by simply multiplying any given integer with itself. Hence we can write the following: </p>

			<p class="math">\( square(x) = x^{2} \) </p>
