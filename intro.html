			<h2>Intro</h2>

			<p>
				Hello dear friend(s)!
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Welcome!</em> :-)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I started this to share some of my little nuggets of learning on the way to Haskell heaven.
				Needless to say, there are tons of various pieces of useful info about <strong><a href="https://www.haskell.org" target="_blank">Haskell</a></strong>, its awesome features, community & eco-system on the internet. But what I have felt lacking among students intending to learn Functional Programming is a deep appreciation &amp; understanding of the core concepts on top of which the whole realm of Functional Programming (of which Haskell is a torch-bearer!) is built, namely the concept of <em>functions, types,</em> and how they are beautifully represented by Haskell in their purest forms. Knowing these concepts properly leads one to experience <strong>Aha!</strong> moments; after all, programming ought to be filled with such Joys & Thrills of discovery!
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyways, this series of articles is <strong>NOT</strong> a Haskell Tutorial. Interested readers can consult the <a href="references">References</a> page for pointers regarding these. What I want to do here is try & share the subtle patterns & beauty in Haskell in particular, especially highlighting how they reflect the core mathematical ideas. If these "essays" could stoke the fire in you & your friends to plunge into the Pilgrimage to Haskell Heaven, I would be so happy indeed! And I'm sure that any such traveller will be rewarded with unforgettable "views" along the way!
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Happy Journey!</strong> And Let's Get Started !!!
			</p>

			<h2>Hello World</h2>
			<p>
				How about the "typical" program that prints "Hello World"? <br>
				Well, here goes the code of such a program called <code>Hello.hs</code>:
			</p>
			<pre class="language-haskell line-numbers">
				<code>
						-- Hello.hs
						main :: IO ()
						main = print "Hello World"
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> let the program-snippet syntax fool you about the I/O system of Haskell being "typical" in any way--especially if you are from an imperative programming language like Java, C++, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				Haskell is one of the rare languages with an almost maniacal obsession about the concept of <em>purity</em>. In a programming language, <em>being pure</em> means that all side-effects are modelled explicitly, rather than being present in an invisible, unpredictable way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Please don't worry. We have a <strong>lot</strong> to speak about the features of Haskell in this space.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				So brace yourselves. You're in for a magical journey into <em>Haskell Heaven!!</em>
